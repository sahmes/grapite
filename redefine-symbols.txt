# This is an input to objcopy.
# The makefile invokes the "ar" tool that breaks extract the objects from the
# GRAPE library (the ".a" file). The objcopy tool is then used to prefix the
# following symbols with __grape_, so they could be called  and overridden by
# grapite functions. Then, "ar" is invoked again to make a new static library.
